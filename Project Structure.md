## 🚀 How to Upload to GitHub

1. **Create a new GitHub repository**
   - Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Name your repo: `linear-regression-demo`
   - Choose Public or Private
   - Do *not* initialize with a README (we’ll upload our own)

2. **Upload the Files**
   - Clone your new repo:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/linear-regression-demo.git
     ```
   - Copy all project files into that folder.
   - Commit and push:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit: Streamlit Linear Regression Demo"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Verify Files**
   Ensure these files are present in your GitHub repository:
   - `streamlit_linear_regression_app.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - Documentation files (README.md, ToDo.md, etc.)

## 💻 Running Locally

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/linear-regression-demo.git
   cd linear-regression-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_linear_regression_app.py
   ```

## 🌐 Deploying on Replit

1. Go to [https://replit.com](https://replit.com) → New Repl → **Import from GitHub**.
2. Paste your GitHub repo URL.
3. Once imported, open the **Shell** and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. In the `.replit` file, set:
   ```ini
   run = "streamlit run streamlit_linear_regression_app.py --server.port=3000 --server.address=0.0.0.0"
   ```
5. Click **Run** to start the app.
6. Optionally, click **Share → Publish** to make your app public.

## 🧩 Optional Add-ons

- **GitHub Pages / Streamlit Cloud** — You can also deploy on Streamlit Cloud directly from GitHub.
- **Assets Folder** — Create a `docs/` or `images/` folder to store screenshots and demo visuals.
- **Version Tagging** — Use `git tag v1.0.0` to mark stable versions.

## ✅ Summary
This folder structure is fully compatible with both **Replit** and **GitHub** workflows. It contains all necessary app code, dependencies, and documentation for classroom demos, data science training, and portfolio presentations.
